What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

The error above means there was an opening curly brace that was not completed.  
It was most likely a hash that was either not closed or was mistakenly closed with a parenthesis.
